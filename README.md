Simon says game with Arduino Uno R3

Please refer to the diagram in 'Circuit Connections.png' for circuit connections.

The game starts when the play button is pressed. 
The LEDs in four different colors flash in a random order, with the number of flashes corresponding to the current level. 
This number increases by one with each level. By providing the correct answer following the same color sequence, you progress to the next level.
In every level, the game speeds up, and when level 50 is completed, the game is won.
